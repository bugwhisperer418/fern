.SH NAME
fern \- a knowledge management system

.SH SYNOPSIS
fern COMMAND [ACTION [ARGS...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fern
is a swiss-army knife for your notetaking and personal knowledge management.
Fern is a helpful commandline tool to manage, curate, and search a vault of your personal notes.
It offers an alternative to heavier GUI personal notetaking management applications for systems that are resource constrained or for users that value the privacy and security of their data.
.PP
Fern uses markdown for all Notes, Templates, and Journal records.
Users are NOT required to pass the '.md' extension when referencing the name of a given Note/Journal/Template as an parameter argument, as Fern will check for and append it, if needed.
.PP
.I NOTE:
Fern requires the environment variable \fB$FERN_VAULT\fR to be assessable and set as the valid, existing path to your Fern vault before it is able to run commands (other than help-related ones).
